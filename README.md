# My First Personal Project

## Playlist Application

This is a **Playlist Application** that allows users to create a playlist of songs. 
Some features will include:
 - adding songs
 - removing songs
 - displaying a list of the songs
 - playing the next song
 - playing previous song
 - replaying current song
This application will be useful for music lovers who love creating playlists of their favourite songs or songs of 
similar genres.
I wanted to make a Playlist application because I love listening to music for different types of tasks such as studying,
working or going on a walk. I feel that creating playlists are helpful for setting a tone for what type of task you are
about to accomplish!
