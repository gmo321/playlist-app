## To-Do List Application

This is a **To-Do List application** that allows users to keep track of their tasks and plan accordingly.
Some features will include being able to *check items off while using different views*. Anyone who needs a To Do list
application to stay organized will find it useful e.g students, employees. I wanted to make a To Do list application
because I found myself switching through way too many systems to stay on top of my tasks because no app had all the main
features I find useful.
